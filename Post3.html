<h2><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Computer-based technology has infiltrated many aspects of life and industry, yet<br>there is little understanding of how it can be used to promote student engagement,<br>a concept receiving strong attention in higher education due to its association with<br>a number of positive academic outcomes. The purpose of this article is to present a<br>critical review of the literature from the past 5 years related to how web-conferencing<br>software, blogs, wikis, social networking sites (Facebook and Twitter), and digital games<br>influence student engagement. We prefaced the findings with a substantive overview<br>of student engagement definitions and indicators, which revealed three types of<br>engagement (behavioral, emotional, and cognitive) that informed how we classified<br>articles. Our findings suggest that digital games provide the most far-reaching influence<br>across different types of student engagement, followed by web-conferencing and<br>Facebook. Findings regarding wikis, blogs, and Twitter are less conclusive and<br>significantly limited in number of studies conducted within the past 5 years. Overall,<br>the findings provide preliminary support that computer-based technology influences<br>student engagement, however, additional research is needed to confirm and build on<br>these findings. We conclude the article by providing a list of recommendations for<br>practice, with the intent of increasing understanding of how computer-based<br>technology may be purposefully implemented to achieve the greatest gains in student<br>engagement</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The digital revolution has profoundly affected daily living, evident in the ubiquity of<br>mobile devices and the seamless integration of technology into common tasks such as<br>shopping, reading, and finding directions (Anderson, 2016; Smith &amp; Anderson, 2016;<br>Zickuhr &amp; Raine, 2014). The use of computers, mobile devices, and the Internet is at<br>its highest level to date and expected to continue to increase as technology becomes<br>more accessible, particularly for users in developing countries (Poushter, 2016). In<br>addition, there is a growing number of people who are smartphone dependent, relying<br>solely on smartphones for Internet access (Anderson &amp; Horrigan, 2016) rather than<br>more expensive devices such as laptops and tablets. Greater access to and demand for<br>technology has presented unique opportunities and challenges for many industries,<br>some of which have thrived by effectively digitizing their operations and services (e.g.,<br>finance, media) and others that have struggled to keep up with the pace of technological innovation (e.g., education, healthcare) (Gandhi, Khanna, &amp; Ramaswamy, 2016).<br>Integrating technology into teaching and learning is not a new challenge for universities. Since the 1900s, administrators and faculty have grappled with how to effectively<br>use technical innovations such as video and audio recordings, email, and teleconferencing to augment or replace traditional instructional delivery methods (Kaware &amp; Sain,<br>2015; Westera, 2015). Within the past two decades, however, this challenge has been<br>much more difficult due to the sheer volume of new technologies on the market. For<br>example, in the span of 7 years (from 2008 to 2015), the number of active apps in<br>Apple’s App Store increased from 5000 to 1.75 million. Over the next 4 years, the number of apps is projected to rise by 73%, totaling over 5 million (Nelson, 2016). Further<br>compounding this challenge is the limited shelf life of new devices and software<br>combined with significant internal organizational barriers that hinder universities from<br>efficiently and effectively integrating new technologies (Amirault, 2012; Kinchin, 2012;<br>Linder-VanBerschot &amp; Summers 2015; Westera, 2015).</p>

<p><strong>STUDENT ENGAGEMENT</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interest in student engagement began over 70 years ago with Ralph Tyler’s research on<br>the relationship between time spent on coursework and learning (Axelson &amp; Flick,<br>2011; Kuh, 2009). Since then, the study of student engagement has evolved and<br>expanded considerably, through the seminal works of Pace (1980; 1984) and Astin<br>(1984) about how quantity and quality of student effort affect learning and many more<br>recent studies on the environmental conditions and individual dispositions that<br>contribute to student engagement (Bakker, Vergel, &amp; Kuntze, 2015; Gilboy, Heinerichs,<br>&amp; Pazzaglia, 2015; Martin, Goldwasser, &amp; Galentino, 2017; Pellas, 2014). Perhaps the<br>most well-known resource on student engagement is the National Survey of Student<br>Engagement (NSSE), an instrument designed to assess student participation in various<br>educational activities (Kuh, 2009). The NSSE and other engagement instruments like it<br>have been used in many studies that link student engagement to positive student outcomes such as higher grades, retention, persistence, and completion (Leach, 2016;<br>McClenney, Marti, &amp; Adkins, 2012; Trowler &amp; Trowler, 2010), further convincing universities that student engagement is an important factor in the teaching and learning<br>process. However, despite the increased interest in student engagement, its meaning is<br>generally not well understood or agreed upon.<br>Student engagement is a broad and complex phenomenon for which there are many<br>definitions grounded in psychological, social, and/or cultural perspectives (Fredricks et<br>al., 1994; Wimpenny &amp; Savin-Baden, 2013; Zepke &amp; Leach, 2010). Review of definitions<br>revealed that student engagement is defined in two ways. One set of definitions refer to<br>student engagement as a desired outcome reflective of a student’s thoughts, feelings,<br>and behaviors about learning. For example, Kahu (2013) defines student engagement as<br>an “individual psychological state” that includes a student’s affect, cognition, and behavior (p. 764). Other definitions focus primarily on student behavior, suggesting that engagement is the “extent to which students are engaging in activities that higher<br>education research has shown to be linked with high-quality learning outcomes”<br>(Krause &amp; Coates, 2008, p. 493) or the “quality of effort and involvement in productive<br>learning activities” (Kuh, 2009, p. 6). Another set of definitions refer to student engagement as a process involving both the student and the university. For example, Trowler<br>(2010) defined student engagement as “the interaction between the time, effort and<br>other relevant resources invested by both students and their institutions intended to<br>optimize the student experience and enhance the learning outcomes and development<br>of students and the performance, and reputation of the institution” (p. 2). Similarly, the<br>NSSE website indicates that student engagement is “the amount of time and effort students put into their studies and other educationally purposeful activities” as well as<br>“how the institution deploys its resources and organizes the curriculum and other<br>learning opportunities to get students to participate in activities that decades of research studies show are linked to student learning”</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY OF FINDINGS</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Findings from our literature review provide preliminary support for including technology as a factor that influences student engagement in existing models (Table 1). One<br>overarching theme is that most of the technologies we reviewed had a positive influence on multiple indicators of student engagement, which may lead to a larger return<br>on investment in terms of learning outcomes. For example, digital games influence all<br>three types of student engagement and six of the seven indicators we identified,<br>surpassing the other technologies in this review. There were several key differences in<br>the design and pedagogical use between digital games and other technologies that may<br>explain these findings. First, digital games were designed to provide authentic learning<br>contexts in which students could practice skills and apply learning (Beckem &amp; Watkins,<br>2012; Farley, 2013; Grimley et al., 2012; Ke et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2014;<br>Marriott et al., 2015; Siddique et al., 2013), which is consistent with experiential learning and adult learning theories. Experiential learning theory suggests that learning occurs through interaction with one’s environment (Kolb, 2014) while adult learning<br>theory suggests that adult learners want to be actively involved in the learning process<br>and be able apply learning to real life situations and problems (Cercone, 2008). Second,<br>students reported that digital games (and gamified elements) are fun, enjoyable, and<br>Table 1 Summary of Findings by Technology and Engagement Indicator<br>Behavioral Emotional Cognitive<br>Participation Interaction Attitudes,<br>interests, and<br>values<br>Sense of<br>belonging<br>Motivation Persistence Deep<br>processing of<br>information<br>Webconferencing      ɸ     √       x      0x    0     x<br>Blogs                          0     √       √    00    0     ɸ<br>Wikis                          ɸ     ɸ       0    00    0      x<br>Facebook                   ɸ      √     √    x0     x      ɸ<br>Twitter                       ɸ      ɸ      0    x0     0     √<br>Games                       x       0     √    x√     x      √</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In 1985, Steve Jobs predicted that computers and software would revolutionize the way<br>we learn. Over 30 years later, his prediction has yet to be fully confirmed in the student<br>engagement literature; however, our findings offer preliminary evidence that the potential is there. Of the technologies we reviewed, digital games, web-conferencing software,<br>and Facebook had the most far-reaching effects across multiple types and indicators of<br>student engagement, suggesting that technology should be considered a factor that influences student engagement in existing models. Findings regarding blogs, wikis, and<br>Twitter, however, are less convincing, given a lack of studies in relation to engagement<br>indicators or mixed findings. Significant methodological limitations may account for<br>the wide range of findings in the literature. For example, small sample sizes, inconsistent measurement of variables, lack of comparison groups, and missing details about<br>specific, pedagogical uses of technologies threaten the validity and reliability of findings.<br>Therefore, more rigorous and robust research is needed to confirm and build upon limited but positive findings, clarify mixed findings, and address gaps particularly regarding<br>how different technologies influence emotional and cognitive indicators of engagement.</p>
