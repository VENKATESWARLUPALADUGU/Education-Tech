<p>Brahmin gurus imparted education by means of begging and not through charging fees or funds<br>from the students or their guardians. Later, temples were also centrees of education. Religiouis<br>education was compulsory but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be<br>brahmacharis or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section<br>of the society had to perform. The priest class, the Brahmins, were imparted knowledge of<br>religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya, were<br>trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade<br>and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages. The<br>book of laws, the Manusmriti, and the treatise on statecraft the Arthashastra were among the<br>influential works of this era which reflect the outlook and understanding of the world at the time.<br>Secular institutions cropped up along with Hindu temples, mutts and Buddhist monasteries.<br>These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning<br>centers became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE.The important<br>urban centers of learning were Taxila (in modern day Pakistan) and Nalanda in Bihar, among<br>others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign<br>students to study topics such as Vedic and Buddhist literature, logic, grammar, etc. Chanakya, a<br>brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers of Taxila, associated with founding of<br>Mauryan Empire.<br>By the time of the visit of the Islamic scholar Alberuni (973â€“1048 CE), India already had a<br>sophisticated system of mathematics.<br>With the arrival of the British Raj in India the modern European education came to India. British<br>Raj was reluctant to introduce mass education system as it was not their interest. The colonial<br>educational policy was deliberately one of reducing indigenous culture and religion, an approach<br>which became known as Macaulayism. This dramatically changed the whole educational system.<br>Educated people failed to get jobs because the language in which they received their education<br>had become redundant. The system soon became solidified in India as a number of primary,<br>secondary, and tertiary centers for education cropped up during the colonial era. Between 1867<br>and 1941 the British increased the percentage of the population in primary and secondary<br>education from around 0.6% of the population in 1867 to over 3.5% of the population in 1941.<br>However, this was much lower than the equivalent figures for Europe, where in 1911 between 8<br>and 18% of the population was in primary and secondary education. Additionally, they made<br>efforts to improve literacy. In 1901, the literacy rate in India was about 5.4%; by India's<br>independence it was nearly 16.5%.<br>The credit for fostering education to the masses following independence in 1947 chiefly goes to<br>the first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. India's first education minister Maulana Azad<br>envisaged strong central government control over education throughout the country, with a<br>uniform educational system.[15] However, given the cultural and linguistic diversity of India, only<br>higher education, which dealt with science and technology, came under the jurisdiction of the<br>central government. The government also held powers to make national policies for educational<br>development and could regulate selected aspects of education throughout India.<br>The central government of India formulated the National Policy on Education (NPE) in 1968 and<br>in 1986 and also reinforced the Programme of Action (POA) in 1992. In 2008 the government<br>initiated several measures the launching of DPEP (District Primary Education Programme) and<br>SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan,ssa.nic.in India's initiative for Education for All) and setting up of<br>Navodaya Vidyalaya and other selective schools in every district, advances in female education,<br>inter-disciplinary research and establishment of open universities. India's NPE also contains the<br>National System of Education, which ensures some uniformity while taking into account<br>regional education needs. The NPE also stresses on higher spending on education, envisaging a<br>budget of more than 6% of the Gross Domestic Product. While the need for wider reform in the<br>primary and secondary sectors is recognized as an issue, the emphasis is also on the development<br>of science and technology education infrastructure.</p>
